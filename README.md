DESCRIPTION:

An Image Gallery is a collection of images displayed in a grid or slideshow format on a webpage. To create an Image Gallery using JavaScript, you can dynamically load images, create HTML elements, and use CSS for styling. JavaScript can add interactivity, like transitions and navigation controls.
This project is built using core web technologies, where HTML provides the foundational structure of the application. The HTML markup defines the layout of the image gallery, including the grid of thumbnails and the modal container used for displaying full-size images. CSS is used extensively to enhance the visual appeal and usability of the gallery. It styles the gallery layout, applies responsive design principles, and introduces dynamic effects such as hover animations, smooth transitions, and fade-in effects for the modal window. Meanwhile, JavaScript brings the application to life by managing user interactions. It controls the modal behavior, handles the next and previous image navigation, and implements an automatic slideshow that cycles through images every few seconds. Together, these technologies create a seamless and interactive user experience, making it easy to view, navigate, and appreciate the image content.
